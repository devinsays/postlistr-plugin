PostListr Plugin
================

I decided it's time to get familiar with Backbone.js + Underscore.js in WordPress.

To start, I watched a talk by @kadamwhite:
[K Adam White on WordPress.tv](http://wordpress.tv/2013/09/05/k-adam-white-evolving-your-javascript-with-backbone-js/)

To get a better idea of how that works in WordPress, I took his standalone PostListr App ([see demo](http://kadamwhite.github.io/wordbone-pressback/)) and turned it into a WordPress plugin.

Still don't quite understand what I'm doing, but getting closer.
